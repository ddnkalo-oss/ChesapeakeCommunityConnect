# **QA Advice for Future Semesters**

# **Training:**

* Follow the VM setup guide  
  * [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D2zQinXb-fsO99lTGxixBIxN16n\_UX8VUopYYzg5vww/edit?usp=drivesdk](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D2zQinXb-fsO99lTGxixBIxN16n_UX8VUopYYzg5vww/edit?usp=drivesdk)  
  * Each project should be on its own VM  
  * Make sure to turn off VM when done  
* Django Training:  
  * Basic Training:  https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/intro/tutorial01/  
  * Additional Automated Testing Training:  https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/testing/

# **Documentation:**

* Make sure you are looking at the correct branch (main/master branch)  
* Update documentation to match site and future meetings with the client   
* Look up a guide for how to write documentation if you need one (don’t add the guide to the sorted documentation, it will make it look messy)

# **Testing:**

* CDSpec test tracker can be used for references and overview of tests that have been or need to be completed  
  * CDSpec Test Tracker: [CDSpec Test Tracker ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JXnmHW933dx8ROGE2fPlyJgb4sFeEEcZB2jGcoh-KBM/edit?gid=0#gid=0)  
* CCC Issues Page via Github: [https://github.com/swbn1/ChesapeakeCommunityConnect-FA24/issues](https://github.com/swbn1/ChesapeakeCommunityConnect-FA24/issues) 

# **Tasks for FA25:**

* Complete Training/Review Old Documentation  
* Populate CDSpec Issues Page  
* Verify the condition of all tests for CDSpec, by filling out the “CDSpec Test Tracker.” Team leads will add the desired response to be completed.   
* Recreate CCC Test Tracker: [CCC STP Test Issues](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rjrGK-2kvhtxj5YzH5lALAZLeiaEAZ_E0H8Z2tm5Dmk/edit?gid=0#gid=0) (Shows which tests need to be reworked, eliminated, or completed)

# **Other Notes:**

* Send bi-weekly reports to team leads but also submit on Blackboard for Simon  
* Use the issues page and remember to assign tasks to people  
* If you run out of tasks to do, ask the team lead/project lead  
* Make sure to do some work outside of class and report the hours in your timesheet (you’re supposed to complete 10 hours a week)  
* Could be useful to create your own google doc and record what you’ve completed to keep track of what to put on your progress report slides
